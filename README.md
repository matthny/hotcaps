# AutoHotKey script that I use for Home Row navigation.

It provides additional keyboard layer activated by holding of CapsLock key:  
* up/down - i/k   
* home/end - j/l    
* volume down/up - 1/2  

Why not all arrows? I used to have all arrows and many more features on my additional layer (check commits), but it was too much. 
This simple, minimalistic version fits my needs best.
